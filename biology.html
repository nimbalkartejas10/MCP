      The Biological Sciences major is intended for the biology student who wishes to develop an individualized combination of courses at the advanced level. The student is free to plan a curriculum of great breadth or to choose an area of specialization not offered as a major by the department. Most of the undergraduates in our Department choose the Biological Sciences major. The Biological Sciences major is suitable for those planning a career in which general familiarity with biological topics is desirable, such as jobs in scientific journalism, biological and pharmaceutical supply industries, biological or medical research, scientific libraries and museums, or in any industry where the products or by-products have potential biological impact. Completing the Biological Sciences major fulfills the basic science requirements for admission to medical, dental, and other health professional schools and to graduate biology programs</p>
