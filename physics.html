    <p>
     Physics is a branch of pure science, dealing with the study and analysis of physical phenomena that take place around us, the nature of the forces responsible for them, and accurate measurement of the physical parameters involved, their interdependence and the laws governing them. This leads to a better understanding of the universe we live in. The laboratory sessions are intended to give the students a hands-on experience of the experiments that enable the verification of the knowledge gained in the theory classes. Problem solving hones the analytical and rational thinking of the students in applying their knowledge to practical situations in life. A degree with physics as one of the optional subjects equips a student to pursue a career in teaching. There is a plethora of research opportunities available in various research institutions available in various Research Institutions of National repute and placements in Research and Development Departments of Scientific Organizations.
