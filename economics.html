    <h2> Objectives :</h2>
    <p>
      The vision of the department of Economics consists of exploring the economic study and analysis, policy framing and implementation issues faced by the Indian economy along with the analysis of other economies in the world. The department thrives to reach standards of excellence in teaching, research and consultancy. The department of Economics recognizes the growing demand for trained manpower in industry, government, research and other sectors as well as nurturing future researchers and specialists in economics. We try to meet this demand in a committed manner.</p>

     <p>The diversity of specializations of the departmental faculty has promoted multi-faceted research at the Department and has brought a certain depth to the PG courses as well. The Department offers a Master’s (two years) course in economics (MA) and Ph.D. in Economics. Every year we get an overwhelming response for Masters from all across India and abroad- the largest in all of social sciences within the University.  </p>
