  <h1> OVERVIEW</h1>
<p>The Faculty of Science is a place for education and research on science. Science is a study that engages in a <i>dialogue with Nature</i> to understand the principles and laws working in the natural world. We strive to unravel the mysteries of nature, starting by asking simple questions such as <b>Why?</b> and <b>How?</b> The principal incentives to do most research activities lie in pure interest, and human wisdom has been accumulated in this manner for many generations. Sometimes the understanding of Nature directly results in applied use in the real world. Other times, it takes a long time before the understanding of Nature brings a significant change to our lifestyles..</p>
