   <h3>About</h3>

<p>Setting up the Mudhoji College was not a very easy task. Facing opposition from skeptics Prof. Shivajirao Bhosale and Shreemant Shivajiraje, began this inevitable task of starting a College with just 50 students of the Arts and Commerce Faculties at the intermediate level. The Late Shreemant Malojiraje graciously consented to the use of the Manmohan Palace for holding Classes in the initial period
</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>In 1958 the College shifted to its present campus on the banks of the Banganga River, near the Harinarayan Tekdi, to the west of the Phaltan city. The foundation stone was laid by the then Chief Minister of Mumbai; Yeshwantrao Chavan.The College building initially had {Ground + One} structure. Today the College which began with a mere 50 Students has grown into a College of about 5000 Students</p>
